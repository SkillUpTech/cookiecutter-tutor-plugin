# Tutor Plugin Cookiecutter for Projects Managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

This project is a fork of [cookiecutter-tutor-plugin](https://github.com/overhangio/cookiecutter-tutor-plugin) for developers who prefer to manage their project using `poetry` rather than `setuptools`.

It is a work in progress.

This is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial2.html) for getting started with [Tutor plugins](https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/plugins.html). 
It will generate a base scaffold for an empty tutor plugin that does, well, nothing.

Requirements
------------

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Usage
-----

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/overhangio/cookiecutter-tutor-plugin.git
```
